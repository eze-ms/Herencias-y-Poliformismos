# Car Properties App

## 📄 Description
This project demonstrates the use of different types of attributes in Java (`static final`, `static`, and `final`) and their behavior in a simple car simulation. It also includes examples of static and non-static methods.

### Functionality
1. **Attributes:**
   - `brand`: A static final attribute shared across all instances.
   - `model`: A static attribute that changes globally when updated.
   - `power`: A final attribute unique to each car instance.
2. **Methods:**
   - `brake()`: A static method that simulates the car braking.
   - `accelerate()`: A non-static method that simulates the car accelerating.
